SlapOnMyFace

Welcome!

After some months, today I started to think different, and maybe this is my return. In this project I will apply everything that I have learned in the past and what I'll learn in the future too, until I get some job in the area, or found my own business.

This is a random project, and it has not a main objetive defined.
